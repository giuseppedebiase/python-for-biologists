'''
The file input.txt contains a number of DNA sequences, one per line. Each sequence 
starts with the same 14 base pair fragment â€“ a sequencing adapter that should have
been removed. Write a program that will (a) trim this adapter and write the cleaned 
sequences to a new file and (b) print the length of each sequence to the screen.
