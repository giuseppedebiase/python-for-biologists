# Look in the chapter_3 folder for a file called genomic_dna.txt â€“ it contains the same 
# piece of genomic DNA that we were using in the final exercise from chapter 2. Write
# a program that will split the genomic DNA into coding and non-coding parts, and 
# write these sequences to two separate files. 
# Hint: use your solution to the last exercise from chapter 2 as a starting point.
# Solution for the last exercise of chapter 2: https://github.com/giuseppedebiase/python-for-biologists/blob/main/2.6_Splicing_out_introns_3.py
