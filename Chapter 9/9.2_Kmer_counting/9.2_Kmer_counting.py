'''
In the chapter_9 folder in the exercises download there is a collection of files with 
the extension .dna which contain DNA sequences of varying length, one per line. 
Use this set of files for both exercises. 
Write a program that will calculate the number of all kmers of a given length across
all DNA sequences in the input files and display just the ones that occur more than 
a given number of times. You program should take two command line arguments â€“ 
the kmer length, and the cutoff number.
